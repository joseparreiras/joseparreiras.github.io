I have recently published a new package on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/joseparreiras/psytest). The package is called `psytest` and it provides a fast way to run the methodology of {% cite phillips2015testing %} to detect bubbles in a financial/economic time series. Here I will provide a brief exercise attempting to replicate the results of the original paper. I will use up-to-date data from Shiller's website. For more information on the module, check the [documentation](https://joseparreiras.github.io/psytest/).
