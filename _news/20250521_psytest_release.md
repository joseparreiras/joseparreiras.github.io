🚀 Just released psytest, a Python package that brings to Python the methodology of Phillips, Shi & Yu (2015) to detect multiple bubbles in time series using the BSADF test.


🏎️ The package uses Numba to accelerate core computations, making large-scale testing fast and efficient.
It also includes a flexible framework for simulating critical values, though extensive simulations are already pre-tabulated and included for convenience.
