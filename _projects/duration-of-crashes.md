In this paper, we investigate the episodes of stock market crashes in the United
States since 1926. We define a crash as a period of time during which the stock
market (measured by the CRSP Index) falls by 10% over its recent peak value. 35
episodes of crashes were identified during this period. When looking at the time
to recovery for each one of these crashes, we see large heterogeneity. In this
paper, we investigate the determinants of this heterogeneity. More specifically,
we look to explain why some episodes take too long to recover, as others take
shorter than expected. We provide economic and statistical explanations for the
causes of these episodes.
