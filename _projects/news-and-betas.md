This paper studies the impact of public information arrival on the dispersion of risk in the stock market. More importantly, I distinguish between the heterogeneous effect of cashflow versus discount rate news. I show that cash flow news tend to generate greater dispersion in the market risk, here analysed by the one factor beta. As cash flow shocks tend to be more heterogeneously spread throughout the market, they impact the risk of many stocks in different sizes and directions. Therefore these type of shocks would likely lead to a higher increase in beta dispersion if compared to discount rate shocks, which tend to be more homogeneous and affect the market more uniformly. By combining real-time news data with high-frequency stock returns, I am able to identify the impact that these information shocks have on the market and link it to the intraday pattern of risk. I show that the distribution of betas in days in which the market is highly affected by cashflow news is significantly wider than average and trends downward along market hours. On the other hand, days in which the market is highly affected by discount rate news display a narrower distribution and a flatter intraday pattern.
